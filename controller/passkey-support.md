# Passkey Setup & Support

## Credential Security

Controller leverages Passkeys to securely provision credentials for signing blockchain transactions. Passkeys can be generated by:

-   Platform authenticators (Face ID, Touch ID)
-   Password managers (Bitwarden, 1Password)

## Platform Support

Passkeys are [generally well supported](https://www.passkeys.io/compatible-devices) across modern platforms. You can use them with:

-   Device authenticators directly
-   Mobile device pairing via QR code flow

If you device does not natively support them, there are several password managers that support Passkey creation and management:

-   [Bitwarden (free)](https://bitwarden.com/help/storing-passkeys/)
-   [1Password](https://1password.com/)
-   [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)

When using a password manager, be sure to install the browser extension as well.

## Backup Solutions

Passkey backup is handled differently depending on your platform or password manager:

#### Apple Devices

Passkeys are backed up with your keychain in iCloud. [Learn more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)

#### Android Devices

Passkeys are backed up with your Google account. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/13168025)

#### Windows Devices

Passkeys can be created and managed as part of your Windows account. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/passkeys)
